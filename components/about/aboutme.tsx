                        myself as a developer. I'm currently exploring Next.js,
                        Tailwind CSS, and animation libraries like Framer

                        computer. Otherwise I'm probably at the gym, reading,
                        taking photos, playing my guitar, or watching anime

                        Leaning on my strengths in Math & Physics, I entered
                        university enrolled in an Electrical Engineering
                        program. Powering through a rigorous curriculum and
                        interning at various companies granted me the
                        opportunities to tackle complex problems and to work
                        with teams of engineers to achieve a common goal.

                        Iâ€™ve been a creator ever since I was a child. I would
                        spend hours drawing my favourite cartoon/anime
                        characters, filling out my sketchbooks. As I got older,
                        I ventured into digital art using Photoshop,
                        specializing in photomanipulation and graphic design,
                        and eventually building a freelance client base. You can

                        A couple years ago I eventually found myself getting
                        into web development. Given my extensive background in
                        graphic design and my education in Engineering I was
                        able to catch on pretty quick and it felt like the
                        perfect path to pursue moving forward, where I can
                        exercise my problem solving skills while expressing my
                        creative side.
